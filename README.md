![Heart Health Banner](https://placehold.co/1200x300/d1e5f0/333333?text=Heart+Disease+Data+Analysis)

**Project Status: Completed** | **Author: [Aman Tiwari]** | 

This repository contains a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns and relationships within the data to better understand the factors that contribute to the presence of heart disease.

## üéØ About the Project

This project performs a deep dive into a classic medical dataset to identify key predictors of heart disease. Through a systematic process of data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, we aim to answer critical questions such as:
- Which demographic and clinical factors are most strongly associated with heart disease?
- What do the distributions of key health metrics like cholesterol and blood pressure look like?
- How do different types of chest pain relate to a heart disease diagnosis?

The insights gained from this EDA serve as a crucial foundation for building an accurate machine learning model for heart disease prediction.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The analysis followed a structured approach to ensure the data was well-understood and prepared for modeling.

1.  **Data Loading**: Loaded the dataset directly from the UCI repository, assigning appropriate column names.
2.  **Initial Inspection**: Checked the data's shape, data types (`.info()`), and summary statistics (`.describe()`).
3.  **Data Cleaning**:
    - Handled missing values (represented as '?') by imputing the `ca` and `thal` columns with their respective **modes**.
    - Corrected the data types for `ca` and `thal` to integer.
4.  **Target Variable Transformation**: Converted the multi-class `target` variable (values 0-4) into a binary variable where `0` represents "No Disease" and `1` represents "Disease".
5.  **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzed individual features using histograms for numerical data and countplots for categorical data to understand their distributions.
6.  **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**: Investigated relationships between features and the target variable using boxplots, countplots with `hue`, a correlation heatmap, and a pairplot.

## üìà Key Findings & Visualizations

### 1. Distribution of Numerical Features
Histograms revealed the underlying distributions of key clinical measurements. The plot below visualizes these distributions.
- `age` and `thalach` (max heart rate) have roughly normal distributions.
- `trestbps` (blood pressure) and `chol` (cholesterol) are right-skewed, with some high-value outliers.
- `oldpeak` (ST depression) is heavily skewed, with most patients having a value of 0.

### 2. Frequency of Categorical Features
Countplots showed the composition of the dataset, highlighting imbalances such as a higher number of male patients.

### 3. Numerical Features vs. Heart Disease
Boxplots provided critical insights into which factors are strong predictors.
- **Higher `thalach` (Max Heart Rate)** is strongly associated with a **lower** probability of heart disease.
- **Higher `oldpeak` (ST Depression)** is a strong indicator of the **presence** of heart disease.

### 4. Categorical Features vs. Heart Disease
Splitting countplots by the target variable revealed clear patterns.
- **Chest Pain (`cp`)**: Patients with chest pain type 0 (typical angina) are far more likely to have heart disease.
- **Exercise Induced Angina (`exang`)**: The presence of exercise-induced angina (`exang=1`) is strongly linked to a positive diagnosis.
- **Sex**: Males in this dataset have a higher prevalence of heart disease compared to females.

### 5. Correlation Matrix
The heatmap visually summarizes the linear relationships between all numerical features.
- `target` shows the strongest **negative correlation with `thalach` (-0.42)** and the strongest **positive correlations with `oldpeak` (0.43) and `ca` (0.39)**.
- This confirms our findings from the boxplots and highlights the most influential features for a predictive model.

### 6. Pair Plot Analysis
The pair plot provides a matrix of scatter plots to visualize the pairwise relationships between key numerical features, colored by the presence or absence of heart disease.
- It helps identify which combinations of features are most effective at separating the two classes.
- The plots for `thalach` vs. `age` and `thalach` vs. `chol` show some separation, confirming that `thalach` is a powerful discriminating feature.

## üèÅ Conclusion

This Exploratory Data Analysis successfully identified several key factors strongly associated with the presence of heart disease. The most significant predictors appear to be:
- **Max Heart Rate (`thalach`)**
- **ST Depression (`oldpeak`)**
- **Number of Major Vessels (`ca`)**
- **Chest Pain Type (`cp`)**
- **Exercise-Induced Angina (`exang`)**

These insights are invaluable for feature selection and engineering in the subsequent phase of building a predictive machine learning model. The clear patterns discovered demonstrate the potential for a model to accurately distinguish between patients with and without heart disease.
